**UPDATE:**
After a half a year from finishing this website I had gained more knowledge and experience as a developer and I realized that the website required a complete code rafactoring since even though I was trying to do my best when writing it back then, the code quality left a lot to be desired. My main objections to the old version of the code involved the code maintaibility and the website accessibility.  
  
Therefore, I decided to move the whole project from pure HTML/SCSS/JS to **Astro** (I actually wanted to learn this technology for several months so I thought this website would be perfect for achieving that) and added **TypeScript** and **ESLint** (including A11y ESLint rules).  
  
At this point I consider the refactoring to be finished, however, I am aware of a few things that could still be improved on this page, therefore it stays open for further refactoring in the future.  
  
  
[This website](https://kepmon.github.io/Website_ZChA/) is a remake of an [actually exisiting website](https://www.zcha.pwr.edu.pl/) that is written in accordance with old standards of coding. That is why I decided to write it intending to adapt it to the newest standards, including, but not limited to, the responsive web design.

This was my first 'serious' website so it could certainly be further improved, however, I tried to do my best with the knowledge that I've gathered so far.

Also, since it was never intended to be hosted on any server, some functionality aspects have beeen purposely omitted, e.g.

- only some of the links on the 'courses' subpages ('Dydaktyka') actually work, i.e., allow to download files. This was because I didn't want to take too much of my local storage space with unnecesary files.
- the English version of the website doesn't exist, because I recognized this would be actually a waste of my time since I wouldn't learn anything new from it. Therefore, I decided to learn new stuff instead by moving on to creating the next website.
