[This website](https://kepmon.github.io/Website_ZChA/) is a remake of an [actually exisiting website](https://www.zcha.pwr.edu.pl/) that is written in accordance with old standards of coding. That is why I decided to write it intending to adapt it to the newest standards, including, but not limited to, the responsive web design.

This was my first 'serious' website so it could certainly be further improved, however, I tried to do my best with the knowledge that I've gathered so far.

Also, since it was never intended to be hosted on any server, some functionality aspects have beeen purposely omitted, e.g.

- only some of the links on the 'courses' subpages ('Dydaktyka') actually work, i.e., allow to download files. This was because I didn't want to take too much of my local storage space with unnecesary files.
- the English version of the website doesn't exist, because I recognized this would be actually a waste of my time since I wouldn't learn anything new from it. Therefore, I decided to learn new stuff instead by moving on to creating the next website.
